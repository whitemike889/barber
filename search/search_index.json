Why? \u00b6 An application will often have hundreds of user viewable strings to power UI, notifications, emails, and other text based user interactions. This leads to many questions about the how to achieve the desired functionality of these user viewable strings: These strings may want to be personalizable! Thus the string would now have to be a template that can render with a data blob unique to each user to produce a personalized string. How can we check that the fillable openings in templates have corresponding values in the data blob? How can templates and data blobs be validated at compile time to protect against runtime exceptions or user visible bugs? What if we want to pass around not just a single template string, but a collection of template strings for more complex documents? How could we support emails that have a subject, body, recipient, primary button\u2026? What about different languages? Could the same unique data blob could be used to support templates in different languages? What about time or money that differ between countries that even share the same language (ie. 12 vs 24 hour time)? How could that formatting localization be provided? To answer the above questions, we built Barber\ud83d\udc88. A type safe Kotlin JVM library for building up localized, fillable, themed documents using Mustache templating. Getting Started \u00b6 To get started using Barber, skim below to understand the different elements used to safely render your localized, fillable, themed documents using Mustache templating. Releases \u00b6 Our change log has release history. API is subject to change. implementation ( \"app.cash.barber:barber:0.1.0\" ) Snapshot builds are available . DocumentData \u00b6 DocumentData is the data that is used to render a template. In Barber, this is defined as a data class making it easy to use in Kotlin. // Define DocumentData data class RecipientReceipt ( val sender : String , val amount : String , val cancelUrl : String , val deposit_expected_at : Instant ) : DocumentData To render a template, for example \"{{sender}} sent you {{amount}}\" , an instance of the above DocumentData could be passed in to fill the fillable openings in the template. Document \u00b6 The final fields of the output, rendered document. For simple documents, this may be a single field. // Define Document data class TransactionalSmsDocument ( val sms_body : String ) : Document For more complex documents that may be used in further processing, there may be multiple fields, which can be nullable. data class TransactionalEmailDocument ( val subject : String , val headline : String , val short_description : String , val primary_button : String ?, val primary_button_url : String ?, val secondary_button : String ?, val secondary_button_url : String ? ) : Document DocumentTemplate \u00b6 A DocumentTemplate is the glue that connects the DocumentData to the Document. It contains: - fields: - keys fulfill all the non-nullable keys of the Document targets - values are Mustache templates that are rendered with the passed in source DocumentData - source: DocumentData that can support all fillable templates in fields - targets: Document s that the DocumentTemplate can render to - locale: Locale for the language of the fields templates val recipientReceiptSmsDocumentTemplateEN_US = DocumentTemplate ( fields = mapOf ( \"sms_body\" to \"{{sender}} sent you {{amount}}\" ), source = RecipientReceipt :: class , targets = setOf ( TransactionalSmsDocument :: class ), locale = Locale . EN_US ) Barber \u00b6 A Barber is typed to the DocumentData -> Document relationship that it knows how to render. Amy knows how to cut blonde hair into a Fu Manchu mustache. Joe knows how to trim brown hair into a soul patch mustache. // A Barber who knows how to render RecipientReceipt data into a TransactionalSmsDocument val recipientReceiptSms : Barber < RecipientReceipt , TransactionalSmsDocument > Barbershop \u00b6 A Barbershop contains all possible Barbers based on the installed DocumentData , DocumentTemplate , and Document s. Each Barber knows how to handle a different combination of DocumentData -> Document . You can call barbershop.getBarber<RecipientReceipt, TransactionalSmsDocument>() to get the Barber that can handle rendering a RecipientReceipt into a TransactionalSmsDocument . // Get a Barber who knows how to render RecipientReceipt data into a TransactionalSmsDocument val recipientReceiptSms = barbershop . getBarber < RecipientReceipt , TransactionalSmsDocument >() You want a soul patch and have brown hair, get Joe! You want a Fu Manchu and have blonde hair, get Amy! You can also get a Map of all Barbers using barbershop.getAllBarbers() . // Get all Barbers val allBarbers : Map < BarberKey , Barber < DocumentData , Document >> = barbershop . getAllBarbers () Note: BarberKey is a data class that let\u2019s us lookup by both DocumentData and Document . BarbershopBuilder \u00b6 A Java style Builder that installs all of the above Barber elements and returns a pre-compiled and validated Barbershop. Install DocumentData and DocumentTemplate pairs with .installDocumentTemplate<RecipientReceipt>(recipientReceiptSmsDocumentTemplateEN_US) . Install Document with .installDocument<TransactionalSmsDocument>() Set a custom LocaleResolver with .setLocaleResolver(MapleSyrupOrFirstLocaleResolver()) Return the finished Barbershop with .build() as the final method call on BarbershopBuilder. val barbershop = BarbershopBuilder () . installDocumentTemplate < RecipientReceipt >( recipientReceiptSmsDocumentTemplateEN_US ) . installDocument < TransactionalSmsDocument >() . build () Barber .render(data: DocumentData, locale: Locale) \u00b6 To render the final Document , a Barber requires a DocumentData , used to fill the DocumentTemplate , and an output Locale. First, the Barber uses a LocaleResolver to find the best Locale match from installed DocumentTemplate s. Then, using the Locale resolved DocumentTemplate , Barber renders the fields of DocumentTemplate using the passed in DocumentData . Returned is the requested Document rendered with the personalized values of DocumentData in the closest match to the requested Locale. // Get a Barber who knows how to render RecipientReceipt data into a TransactionalSmsDocument val recipientReceiptSms = barbershop . getBarber < RecipientReceipt , TransactionalSmsDocument >() // Create the RecipientReceipt instance that holds the personalized data val sandy50Receipt = RecipientReceipt ( sender = \"Sandy Winchester\" , amount = \"$50\" , cancelUrl = \"https://cash.app/cancel/123\" , deposit_expected_at = Instant . parse ( \"2019-05-21T16:02:00.00Z\" ) ) // Render the final document using the personalized DocumentData instance and the output Locale val renderedSms = recipientReceiptSms . render ( sandy50Receipt , EN_US ) @BarberField, BarberFieldEncoding, and HTML Character Escaping \u00b6 The @BarberField annotation can be used on Document class val fields to declare that the field should be rendered and treated according to a specific BarberFieldEncoding . BarberFieldEncoding can be for now STRING_HTML or STRING_PLAINTEXT . By default, all fields are treated as STRING_HTML and have common HTML escaping of characters for safety. When a field is annotated as STRING_PLAINTEXT , characters will not be escaped. data class EncodingTestDocument ( val no_annotation_field : String , @BarberField () val default_field : String , @BarberField ( encoding = BarberFieldEncoding . STRING_HTML ) val html_field : String , @BarberField ( encoding = BarberFieldEncoding . STRING_PLAINTEXT ) val plaintext_field : String ) : Document // Rendered with all fields set to `You purchased 100 shares of McDonald's.` EncodingTestDocument ( no_annotation_field = \"You purchased 100 shares of McDonald&#39;s.\" , default_field = \"You purchased 100 shares of McDonald&#39;s.\" , html_field = \"You purchased 100 shares of McDonald&#39;s.\" , // Note: no character escaping on the plaintext field plaintext_field = \"You purchased 100 shares of McDonald's.\" ) Locale \u00b6 Barber supports installation and resolution of multiple Locales for each DocumentTemplate . All Locale versions of a DocumentTemplate will be installed with the BarbershopBuilder. The desired output Locale is then provided at render time and the best available option is resolved. // Define DocumentTemplate in English val recipientReceiptSmsDocumentTemplateEN_US = DocumentTemplate ( fields = mapOf ( \"sms_body\" to \"{{sender}} sent you {{amount}}\" ), source = RecipientReceipt :: class , targets = setOf ( TransactionalSmsDocument :: class ), locale = Locale . EN_US ) // Define DocumentTemplate in Canadian English val recipientReceiptSmsDocumentTemplateEN_CA = DocumentTemplate ( fields = mapOf ( \"sms_body\" to \"{{sender}} sent you {{amount}}, eh!\" ), // ... same as EN_US locale = Locale . EN_CA ) // Define DocumentTemplate in Spanish val recipientReceiptSmsDocumentTemplateES_US = DocumentTemplate ( fields = mapOf ( \"sms_body\" to \"{{sender}} te envi\u00f3 {{amount}}\" ), // ... same as EN_US locale = Locale . ES_US ) // Use above elements to build a Barbershop val barbershop = BarbershopBuilder () . installDocumentTemplate < RecipientReceipt >( recipientReceiptSmsDocumentTemplateEN_US ) . installDocumentTemplate < RecipientReceipt >( recipientReceiptSmsDocumentTemplateEN_CA ) . installDocumentTemplate < RecipientReceipt >( recipientReceiptSmsDocumentTemplateES_US ) . installDocument < TransactionalSmsDocument >() . build () // Get a Barber who knows how to render RecipientReceipt data into a TransactionalSmsDocument val recipientReceiptSms = barbershop . getBarber < RecipientReceipt , TransactionalSmsDocument >() // Render in each Locale val smsEN_US = recipientReceiptSms . render ( sandy50Receipt , EN_US ) // = Sandy Winchester sent you $50 val smsEN_CA = recipientReceiptSms . render ( sandy50Receipt , EN_CA ) // = Sandy Winchester sent you $50, eh? val smsES_US = recipientReceiptSms . render ( sandy50Receipt , ES_US ) // = Sandy Winchester te envio $50 LocaleResolver \u00b6 Determining based on a Locale passed in at render which installed Locale to render is done by a LocaleResolver. It is a simple interface that looks like this: interface LocaleResolver { /** * @return a [Locale] from the given [options] * @param [options] must be valid keys for a Locale keyed Map */ fun resolve ( locale : Locale , options : Set < Locale >): Locale } Barber comes with a very simple MatchOrFirstLocaleResolver that attempts to resolve the requested Locale exactly, and otherwise fallsback to the first installed Locale. For more complex resolving algorithms, you can set your own custom LocaleResolver when building your Barbershop. val barbershop = BarbershopBuilder () // ... . setLocaleResolver ( MapleSyrupOrFirstLocaleResolver ()) // Always tries to resolve EN_CA . build () Integration with Guice \u00b6 If you use Guice, creating a module that automatically binds all possible typed Barber instances is simple. See the code example below. package com.your.service.package import com.google.inject.AbstractModule import com.google.inject.Key import com.google.inject.util.Types import app.cash.barber.Barber import app.cash.barber.Barbershop import app.cash.barber.models.BarberKey import app.cash.barber.models.Document import app.cash.barber.models.DocumentData /** * Binds all the barbers so they may be injected directly like so: * * ``` * @Inject var barber: Barber<RecipientReceipt, TransactionalSmsDocument> * ``` */ class BarberModule ( private val barbershop : Barbershop ) : AbstractModule () { override fun configure () { barbershop . getAllBarbers (). forEach { ( barberKey , barber ) -> bind ( barberKey . asGuiceKey ()). toInstance ( barber ) } } private fun BarberKey . asGuiceKey (): Key < Barber < DocumentData , Document >> { val barberType = Types . newParameterizedType ( Barber :: class . java , documentData . java , document . java ) @Suppress ( \"UNCHECKED_CAST\" ) // We know this cast is safe dynamically. return Key . get ( barberType ) as Key < Barber < DocumentData , Document >> } } Coming Soon \u00b6 FieldStemming \u00b6 Automatically replace Money, DateTime, and Instant types with BarberMoney, BarberDateTime, and BarberInstant that let templates call out localized formatted output of each type. Example BarberInstant(Instant(2019-05-15T15:23:11), EN_US) = mapOf( \"date\" to \"May 15, 2019\", \"time\" to \"3:23 pm\", \"casual\" to \"tomorrow at 3pm\" ) BarberMoney(Money(50_00), EN_US) = mapOf( \"full\" to \"$50.00\" \"casual\" to \"$50\" ) License \u00b6 Copyright 2019 Square, Inc.
